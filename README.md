MentorMatch is a Single Page Application (SPA) where users can sign up as either "Mentors" (who offer skills) or "Students" (who book sessions). It bridges the gap between casual learning and professional tutoring by allowing quick, one-off booking of video call sessions for specific skills (e.g., "Code Review", "Guitar Tuning", "French Basics").
